        memorization tips
        
        Do it in parts
        reat -> outline (split and group things)-> understand
        can do recursively: find out the parts at the top, learn the heads of the top, then recurse on first head (dfs)
        for each part, use multiple sessions with breaks in between, read -> familiarize -> outline -> try to memo -> one success -> easy 
        0-3 sessions of 5-10min per day, uses breaks to memorize more efficiently, for example wake, evening is probably most efficient
        scrolling on note iphone (hides next line) is flashcard with less effort
        goal = effort--, time--, understanding++
        contra mnemonics, all encoding or decoding that is not from heads <-> parts
        because when saying, you will always thing about encoding, but shouldn't be thinking about light things (mnemonics), but okay to think about heads and parts
        remember end of memo is understanding and judgement
        no memory palace, structure of thing itself (heads and parts) is enough palace
        it is evident that verse numbers also should not be memorized (light), but rather speeches, stories, smaller parts, bigger parts
        zooming out, obviously need meta strategy for what to memorize
        it is evident that that list should be ordered by use++ short++ catholic++ inability to err++ 
        "Labour to understand the true method of divinity, and see truths in their several degrees and order; that you take not the last for the first, nor the lesser for the greater. Therefore see that you be well grounded in the catechism; and refuse not to learn some catechism that is sound and full, and keep it in memory while you live."
